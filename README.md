<p>I want to address the theme of <em><strong>trust</strong></em> in this project due to the growing insecurity of people and the isolation of themselves from other people.</p>
<h1 id="font-size5question-is-there-a-correlation-between-the-characteristics-of-the-neighbors-and-trust-your-neighborhoodfont"><font size="5">Question: Is there a correlation between the characteristics of the neighbors and trust your neighborhood?</font></h1>

I wanted to compare V170(Secure in Neighborhood), V103(Trust: Your Neighborhood), V42(Neighbours: Heavy Drinkers) and V36(Neighbours: Drug Addicts) from the list on World Value Survey Website.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4</strong><br>

In this data visualization, we see that the secure in the neighborhood has been decreasing gradually over the years. Although there are minor increases in the following years, the percentage is quite low.</p>
